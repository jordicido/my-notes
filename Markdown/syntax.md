# Markdown cheatsheet

## This is a cheatsheet where you can find a basic guide on how to work with markdown

### Headers

In order to make headers we use the "#" character. The more "#" characters you use corresponds to the different levels of header you can have, i.e. "###" corresponds to a h3

### Emphasis

"*" or "_" is used on both sides of word/s in order to make them italic
"**" or "__" is used on both sides of word/s in order to make them bold

i.e. I'm _italic_ and I'm **bold**

### Lists

#### Unordered

Using one "*" character in front of two or more items will convert them to an unordered list.

i.e. Grocery List:
* Peaches
* Watermelon
* Carrots
* Tomatoes

#### Ordered

In the same way as unordered lists using "1." in front of two or more items will convert them to an ordered list.

i.e. Classification:
1. Barça
1. Atlético
1. Valencia
1. Madrid
